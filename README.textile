h1. Installation

gem install vraptor-scaffold

h1. Getting Started

At the command line client:
 
* vraptor new myapp
* Change directory into myapp
* vraptor scaffold product name:string value:double
* ant jetty.run
* Go http://localhost:8080/products

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
